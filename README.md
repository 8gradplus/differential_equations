# Differential Equations

Playaround with partial differential equations (PDEs) and stochastic differetnial equations (SDEs)
Focus on using neural networks for generating solutions.

    - elaborates boundary conditions
    - how to solve it also numerically
    - how to make contact with real data
    - how to transform it to a heat equation
